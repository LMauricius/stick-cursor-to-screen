# stick-cursor-to-screen
A simple uncreatively-named program for X11 window system that prevents the cursor from crossing into another monitor when you do't want it to. 

Windows has this feature for the corners, while few Linux DEs have it, so working with multiple monitors on Linux can be annoying since I'm used to throwing my mouse into the corners to push buttons all the time. This programs adds exactly that - and its behaviour is highly customizable. The default tries to resist cursor movement when you're trying to hit a button in the edge of the screen, while letting the cursor pass (almost) freely when you actually want it to cross into the other screen.
